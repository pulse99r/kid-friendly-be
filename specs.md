# kid-friendly api
* a social-media space specifically for young people under the age of 18

## who can join:
* young people under the age of 18
* their parents, only as responsible adults accompanied by a child
* Children lose the ability to interact with other when they graduate high school, or reach the age of 18, which ever come first.
* after removal, they will have access to they childhood communication history, but not be able to communicte within those communities, and their communications will not be visible to younger children.

## process fo joining
* kids apply with parents help (i.e. kids fill out part of the application, parents fillout part of the application, school admin completes part of the application)
* no child allowed to join without their parent's knowlege, which is determed by the parent response to their child's application
* School admins not allowed to join site, just validate identity of children
* phone numbers for children tracked, and required to be the same as the parent's phone number
* parents may join as chaperones among children's groups that include their own child (or children).
* parents are not allowed to interact with any child except their own
* applications are inspected by live person who reviews documents (birth certificates, drivers license, state/municipal id, shool id)

## visibility of communications
### Age goups
* age 0 - 7
* age 8 - 12 
* age 13 - 14
* age 15 - 18
* 18 and above (adult) 
* parents have visibility within any age group or community in which their own children participate, however they cannot communicate directly with children via the site.

## safety precautions
* contact and identifying information is collected only for the purpose of authenticating users (age, unique identity, school attended).  This enables us to determine whether we are seeing a real child and protect against fake accounts.
* materials within the young people's division is strictly monitored (by parents, administrators and AI systems) actively enforce the kid-friendly protocols.
